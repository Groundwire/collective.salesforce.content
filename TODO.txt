planned:
- add a screen with info about the sync, instructions on how to run via cron
  - is it possible to have some sort of status indicator?
  - move away from cron4plone
- clean up settings when the behavior is disabled
- support more field types
  - date
  - picklist (w/ sync of vocab)
- support setting workflow state based on some field in SF, somehow
- what happens to the mapping when you rename a field?
- indicate field mapping on the field edit UI?
- somehow detect and report when sync fails due to changes on Salesforce side
  - e-mail to site admin as well as technical contact

backlog:
- default converter should probably just decode then use the field's
  fromUnicode method
  --> maybe?
- mark fields as searchable (probably belongs in a separate behavior)
- sync fields from referenced objects
- reconstructing object relations
- support attachments
- push changes back to Salesforce
- sync a single object from Salesforce
- view editor
- support TALES expression in criteria setting???
- better widget for specifying target path
