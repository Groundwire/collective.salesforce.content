planned:
- add a screen with info about the sync, instructions on how to run via cron
  - is it possible to have some sort of status indicator?
- clean up settings when the behavior is disabled
- support more field types
  - date
  - picklist (w/ sync of vocab)
- support setting workflow state based on some field in SF, somehow

backlog:
- mark fields as searchable (probably belongs in a separate behavior)
- sync fields from referenced objects
- reconstructing object relations
- support attachments
- push changes back to Salesforce
- view editor
- support TALES expression in criteria setting
- better widget for specifying target path
